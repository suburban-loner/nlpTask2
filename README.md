Semantic Similarity Example
This is an example of how to use spaCy to compute semantic similarity between words and phrases. The program calculates the similarity score between pairs of words or phrases using the pre-trained language models 'en_core_web_sm' and 'en_core_web_md'.

Getting Started
To use this program, you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine along with the spaCy library. You can install spaCy by running the following command:
pip install spacy

After installing spaCy, you also need to download the language models by running the following commands:
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
python -m spacy download en_core_web_md

Usage
You can run the program by executing the following command:
python semantic.py
